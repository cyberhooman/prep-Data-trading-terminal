# Frontend Design Skill

Generates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## When to Use

Automatically activate this skill when working on frontend design tasks like:
- "Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
- "Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
- "Design a settings panel with dark mode"
- Any UI/UX design or styling work

## Core Principles

**Design Strategy**: Before coding, establish a bold aesthetic direction by considering purpose, tone, technical constraints, and what makes the interface memorable. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

### Key Focus Areas

**Typography**
- Select distinctive, characterful fonts rather than defaults
- Pair display fonts with refined body fonts for visual interest
- Avoid overused typefaces (system defaults, generic sans-serif)

**Color & Theme**
- Develop cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents
- Manage through CSS variables for consistency
- Avoid cliched color schemes (particularly overused purple gradients)

**Motion & Animation**
- Implement purposeful animations
- Emphasize high-impact page load sequences with staggered reveals
- Avoid scattered micro-interactions without purpose

**Spatial Composition**
- Employ unexpected layouts using asymmetry, overlap, and diagonal flows
- Break from conventional grid patterns when appropriate
- Create visual hierarchy through deliberate spacing

**Visual Details**
- Build atmosphere through gradients, textures, patterns
- Add contextual effects matching the overall aesthetic
- Every detail should reinforce the design direction

## What to Avoid

- Generic conventions and cookie-cutter patterns
- Overused typefaces and default fonts
- Cliched color schemes without context
- Predictable layouts lacking character
- Unnecessary complexity that doesn't serve the vision

## Implementation Approach

Match complexity to vision:
- **Maximalist designs**: Warrant elaborate code with extensive effects
- **Refined designs**: Demand restraint and precision in spacing and typography

Choose a clear aesthetic direction and implement production code with meticulous attention to detail.
